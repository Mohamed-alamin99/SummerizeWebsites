      "\n",
      "*   **Ancient Egyptians invented toothpaste!** Long before modern dental hygiene, they created a paste from ingredients like ox hooves, ashes, burnt eggshells, and pumice to clean their teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The oldest known peace treaty in the world is Egyptian.** It's the Treaty of Kadesh, signed between the Egyptians (led by Ramesses II) and the Hittites around 1259 BC. It's inscribed on a clay tablet and still exists today!\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cats were highly revered, and even worshiped.** The ancient Egyptians believed cats were sacred animals. Harming a cat was a serious crime, and many were mummified after death, just like humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.** It held this record until the Lincoln Cathedral in England was completed in the 14th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cleopatra was not Egyptian!** While she ruled Egypt, she was actually of Greek descent, a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt for centuries after Alexander the Great's conquest.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ancient Egyptians wore makeup.** Both men and women wore kohl (a dark eyeliner made from ground galena) not just for beauty, but also to protect their eyes from the sun and potentially repel flies.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Egyptians invented the calendar.** They developed a solar calendar with 365 days, which is remarkably similar to the one we use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bread was a form of currency.** In ancient Egypt, workers were often paid in loaves of bread and jars of beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The modern-day flag of Egypt has a history dating back to the Napoleonic era.** The current design, featuring the Eagle of Saladin, is a modern iteration of flags used since the early 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Egypt has the longest continuous presidential system in the modern Arab world.** The presidential role has existed in various forms for decades.\n",
